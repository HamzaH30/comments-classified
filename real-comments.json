Original works, such a parody I wrote, filmed, and produced have been taken down for &quot;pirating&quot; footage from the newest film. Seems that has been the only reason they use to take down content, irregardless of what the video is. &quot;Bully Maguire&quot; meme channels have been a high target from these assholes lately, and their videos, or even channels in worst cases, are terminated for &quot;using NWH footage.&quot; These guys aren&#39;t even a legitimate company, and YouTube has refused to get involved. It&#39;s one thing to have this kind of content taken down by copyright owners (such as Sony, Disney, or Insomniac because even GAMEPLAY footage has been taken down), but Aiplex owns NOTHING. They aren&#39;t a real company with any real legal standing to do this to anyone. I made a video detailing the entire situation in-depth, which Aiplex even tried to take down, even though it&#39;s just me talking into a camera with no background music. We need bigger YouTubers to speak out about this. YouTube refuses to get involved, even when faced with a petition that bears 25,000 signatures to look into Aiplex. This &quot;Nintendo&quot; situation is only a small piece of a larger puzzle. So many small channels are needlessly at stake because YouTube allows assholes like these guys to just claim content whenever they want."

    "comment": "Honestly, I&#39;m going through this right now with YouTube.<br><br>I uploaded a review of Evil Bong in 2012, and one of the many &quot;AdRev&quot; entities claimed it, saying I used the material they owned. Specifically, the 13 Nights of Elvira Evil Bong episode. However, said episode was not released until December 2014.<br><br>I disputed, as you do, and they rejected. I appealed, and now they&#39;re aiming to give my channel a copyright strike for my trouble.<br><br>As I do movie reviews almost exclusively and use a lot of copyrighted content in my videos, I&#39;m more than used to the dispute process and the fact that fair use or not, YouTube refuses to ever side with the creator. It&#39;s guilty until proven innocent, but this claim was so ridiculous - that I used copyrighted material that didn&#39;t even exist yet when I produced my video - I actually went to YouTube themselves.<br><br>Or team youtube on Twitter anyway... it&#39;s the best most of us can do.<br><br>After explaining the situation, they came back and told me that AdRev is perfectly in the right because even though I used footage from Evil Bong, a movie owned by Full Moon Features, as AdRev are dealing with the digital rights of an episode of Elvira that licensed the movie, through some digital dark magic AdRev are now the rightful copyright owners of Evil Bong and are freely allowed to strike me as they see fit and I just have to deal with it.<br><br>Since then I have been trying to get in contact with Full Moon themselves to see what they think about it, but unfortunately it has been eight years since I last worked with them and my contact has evidently moved on and his e-mail no longer works. Trying to bring this up to the company via their merch sales support staff has been less than fruitful.<br><br>I&#39;m certain I&#39;ll fight through this copyright strike just as I have the 10+ others I&#39;ve received over the years, but the fact that the system is so broken that someone can claim copyright for material they don&#39;t own, based on a claim that isn&#39;t even possible to be true from the most basic understanding of how time works, and STILL I&#39;m just gonna have to deal with it and hopefully not lose my channel?

The owner there was listed as Full Moon Features.<br><br>I can point to a time this certainly happened to me in the past, fraudulently. Heck, anyone here can test this method out: Upload some public domain stuff! Companies like AdRev love throwing that into the content ID system to claim it until the end of time. One of the reasons I stopped doing public domain movie riffs as a supporter reward... Of note, Little Dot Studios claimed my riff of The Ghoul (1936) which was not only in the public domain, but had a long, well documented history of how and when it got into the public domain. Presenting LDS with this information... they gave my channel a copyright strike.<br><br>They&#39;re still operating to this day, of course. You can find employee reviews of them, where their own staff feel horrible for these kinds of business practices. They believe it&#39;s legal, but they also find it repugnant."

    "comment": "Here is an article I found and for the past week, I&#39;ve been doing alot of digging.  This is what i do not understand about Nintendo now with committing a mass genocide on fan creations and gameplay vids . Cus what is said here according to this article that Shigeru Miyamoto Approves Of People Uploading Gameplay Videos said&quot; , I think it\u2019s good that there\u2019s a variety of ways to enjoy things. In the ROM era, we preferred to have [customers] play for a long time with materials created with very miniscule memory without publicising them. At that time, it would be problematic if the whole game content were to be revealed. But it is now an era where customers that bought [the games] publish videos broadly, and I think that may pique interest about those games to other people who watch it. I think I would also watch walkthrough videos of [games] made by someone else. Honestly, I don\u2019t want to watch my own [games], but if it\u2019s made by someone else it should still be okay.&quot; <br><br>So..<br><br>My brain is still trying to process what the big deal is that Nintendo would even react irrationally to something that isn&#39;t potentially harmful to the company.  We are in a new Era now. This isn&#39;t the 80s anymore . Let&#39;s plays, game reviews,  all fall within fair use to a huge extent.  And it&#39;s like what I said in my last topic video which is still up for anyone to watch,  is that for Nintendo,  if in this instance,  had been the one to actually block all those music tracks ... even if it&#39;s legal,  it just doesn&#39;t settle right with me. And i may just do another analysis video that extends further on the topic of Nintendo and what I learned about them in the last few years to the current date.  <br><br>While I&#39;m not a huge fan of Nintendo games,  I appreciate Mario Kart Brothers and I&#39;ve ever played Mario Kart wii,  then any other game really . And in another article I found talked about Nintendo&#39;s 2012 campaign slogan which was &quot; I&#39;m not a gamer...&quot; and what really hit me hard about this article was a statement that was made by Nintendo,  which basically said that we want&quot;  normal &quot; people to enjoy our games and not &quot; basement trolls&quot;. What the heck does that mean? What do you mean by normal?"

He obviously disputed the claim and after a few weeks of still lost ad revenue the fake channel didn&#39;t approve of the claim.<br><br>Thefatrat even showed proof of the licensing he has done, this is a officially released music soundtrack with his name in it and all. And YouTube just startes that they don&#39;t mediate on copyright claims. It&#39;s su ridiculously fucked up, it&#39;s like someone breaks into your house and steals your tv, goes to the cops telling that you stole his TV and they arrest you.

Or the simple fact people complained about how you can&#39;t upload Mario Kart, Mario party, Zelda, pokemon gameplay etc etc....but yet not one single channel I watch ever stopped nor had issues with uploading Nintendo content.<br><br><br><br>Its actually funny how facts prove that Sony/Playstation is the #1 issue, and it&#39;s the Playstation fanbase that has been caught trying to sabotage nearly anything that is a threat to their brand"

Few years ago during the Smash DLC character announcements people realized that just before Banjo was announced, some Banjo &amp; Kazooie music got copyright claimed by the actual Nintendo, if memory serves. A few months later, some Super Mario RPG music got claimed (the song Beware The Forest Mushrooms was mentioned here in Charlie&#39;s vid) and people took that to mean a character from that game would be added to Smash. This theory was mostly popular in a theory circle dedicated to that character, whom a lot of people love and a lot of people hate. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the original takedown of Beware was from some troll trying to mess with that community. (I&#39;m specifically thinking of the PapaGenos community, but I know it extended past his fanbase a bit). They probably just got power trippy and went after Gilva, cuz he&#39;s known as a menace to Nintendo lol"

    "comment": "The biggest problem with the Lechmere theory is that the \u201cresearch\u201d began with the assumption that Lechmere was the Ripper and then the research went backwards to try and fit Lechmere into the murders. Furthermore, even doing this, there is zero strong evidence against him.<br><br>The biggest thing some people claim is that Lechmere lied to the police and gave them a false name. Did he? Sure. But interestingly enough, he also gave them his correct address and his place of employment. So it\u2019s more likely that he was commonly using the name Cross because it makes no sense to give a false name but still tell the police where you live.<br><br>There was one witness who saw Lechmere standing over the body. Robert Paul\u2019s own testimony was that Nichols body was very cold. It takes 10 to 20 minutes for a body to get cold. The \u201cevidence\u201d against Lechmere claims he was caught in the act or immediately afterward.<br><br>Another piece of evidence is that he was a local Whitechapel resident and most people believed the Ripper was local. Fine and dandy. There were thousands of other local residents and most Ripper suspects fit this description. Also, Nichols body was found on his route to work. Well, duh. He wasn\u2019t going to find the body on his way to work if it wasn\u2019t on his route. This is just lazy reasoning.<br><br>Other than Elizabeth Stride, all the victims were on his route to work. And of course Stride was murdered close to the house that Lechmere\u2019s mother lived. So one night, on the way to visit his mom, he decides to murder someone. I mean, why go over to mom\u2019s house if you haven\u2019t strangled a lady before? If Lechmere was such a impulsive murderer as to do this, why did he stop murdering and live for decades longer?<br><br>Edward Stow \u201cThe police at the time were looking for some sort of special individual. But most crimes turn out to be someone quite ordinary. He [Cross] walked past every single murder scene on his way to work. He is the best suspect so far.&quot;<br><br>The above paragraph is one of the more amusing things I have come across in regards to Lechmere. Stow claims that the police were looking for some sort of special individual and that\u2019s why they didn\u2019t suspect Lechmere. This makes no sense because the police were NOT looking for some sort of special individual. Nichols was the first canonical ripper murder. Her body was found on August 31. At the time, they were not looking for a special person that fit a profile of a serial killer named Jack the Ripper or a serial killer at all. It would be weeks and more murders before the police began looking for a \u201cspecial individual.\u201d<br><br>Everything about Lechmere is circumstantial. But the biggest piece of evidence, that being the false name, is completely negated by him giving the correct home address and place of work. It is highly unlikely he was the Ripper."

They claim these videos are using footage from No Way Home but that is not the case. Original works, such a parody I wrote, filmed, and produced have been taken down for &quot;pirating&quot; footage from the newest film. Seems that has been the only reason they use to take down content, irregardless of what the video is. &quot;Bully Maguire&quot; meme channels have been a high target from these assholes lately, and their videos, or even channels in worst cases, are terminated for &quot;using NWH footage.&quot; These guys aren&#39;t even a legitimate company, and YouTube has refused to get involved. It&#39;s one thing to have this kind of content taken down by copyright owners (such as Sony, Disney, or Insomniac because even GAMEPLAY footage has been taken down), but Aiplex owns NOTHING. They aren&#39;t a real company with any real legal standing to do this to anyone. I made a video detailing the entire situation in-depth, which Aiplex even tried to take down, even though it&#39;s just me talking into a camera with no background music. Charlie, we need bigger YouTubers to speak out about this. YouTube refuses to get involved, even when faced with a petition that bears 25,000 signatures to look into Aiplex. This &quot;Nintendo&quot; situation is only a small piece of a larger puzzle. So many small channels are needlessly at stake."

I know that some music publishers (especially ones from back in the day) will use the song\u2019s creator rather than the label\u2019s name in copyright notices. This could make sense if the music that was taken down was available on CD. Not sure though, just throwing my little hat of experience into the ring."

(instantly meaning 24 hours or less. which, i would say for the scale of this situation, is pretty damn instant.) the person, or group, could&#39;ve hired someone, or they have their own guy, who can build an algorithm to delete this guy&#39;s videos. i would call this a trial run of sorts. but that&#39;s just a hypothesis.

You can easily make thousands of dollars doing this, YouTube doesn&#39;t do shit about it and I don&#39;t <b>think</b> it technically breaks any laws (I&#39;m no lawyer and certainly don&#39;t condone this behaviour) so people run wild with it.

They claim these videos are using footage from No Way Home but that is not the case. Original works, such a parody I wrote, filmed, and produced have been taken down for &quot;pirating&quot; footage from the newest film. Seems that has been the only reason they use to take down content, irregardless of what the video is. &quot;Bully Maguire&quot; meme channels have been a high target from these assholes lately, and their videos, or even channels in worst cases, are terminated for &quot;using NWH footage.&quot; These guys aren&#39;t even a legitimate company, and YouTube has refused to get involved. It&#39;s one thing to have this kind of content taken down by copyright owners (such as Sony, Disney, or Insomniac because even GAMEPLAY footage has been taken down), but Aiplex owns NOTHING. They aren&#39;t a real company with any real legal standing to do this to anyone. I made a video detailing the entire situation in-depth, which Aiplex even tried to take down, even though it&#39;s just me talking into a camera with no background music. We need bigger YouTubers like Charlie to speak out about this. YouTube refuses to get involved, even when faced with a petition that bears 25,000 signatures to look into Aiplex. This &quot;Nintendo&quot; situation is only a small piece of a larger puzzle. So many small channels are needlessly at stake."

Making content has never been easier, for copyrights to work for all these people they can not be forced to give youtube their personal details just to call out that some youtuber is using their song as his intro... Someone uses my song, I send youtube my info, they need to check that this is right.. how do they do that? How do I as a Bulgarian citizen prove to Youtube that I&#39;m Lord Sanzibar the Fluteboy? My business is only registered in Lichtenstein...

They did give the whole generic &#39;if the creator thinks this is wrong, blah blah blah dispute it with a robot bla bla bla&#39;, which could mean it&#39;s a robot reply, but I kinda doubt it from the way the rest of the Tweet was written, and I bet with all of these copyright response Tweets they have to include that. And people do think YT is still lying, but people have asked a very important question which I also ask: What would YouTube have to gain from lying about this? Gilva wasn&#39;t monetized, YT wasn&#39;t putting any ads on Gilva&#39;s channel from what I could tell, they weren&#39;t making any money, so YouTube has no reason to lie, if they were making money off of Gilva they wouldn&#39;t just lie about this. I&#39;d think that in a case where there&#39;s so many people upset about this, YouTube would try their absolute best to confirm or deconfirm that it was Nintendo, and considering YouTube/Google&#39;s size, I bet they have SOME way to contact Nintendo for this kind of info.<br>Really, it comes down to this: If this was Nintendo, it just shows how stupid they can be and gives us another reason to be mad at them, if it was a person pretending to be Nintendo, that person is scummy and in huge legal trouble, because this would be a case where Nintendo would be right on the case with Nintendo Ninjas and all that stuff."

They claim these videos are using footage from No Way Home but that is not the case. Original works, such a parody I wrote, filmed, and produced have been taken down for &quot;pirating&quot; footage from the newest film. Seems that has been the only reason they use to take down content, irregardless of what the video is. &quot;Bully Maguire&quot; meme channels have been a high target from these assholes lately, and their videos, or even channels in worst cases, are terminated for &quot;using NWH footage.&quot; These guys aren&#39;t even a legitimate company, and YouTube has refused to get involved. It&#39;s one thing to have this kind of content taken down by copyright owners (such as Sony, Disney, or Insomniac because even GAMEPLAY footage has been taken down), but Aiplex owns NOTHING. They aren&#39;t a real company with any real legal standing to do this to anyone. I made a video detailing the entire situation in-depth, which Aiplex even tried to take down, even though it&#39;s just me talking into a camera with no background music. Charlie, we need bigger YouTubers to speak out about this. YouTube refuses to get involved, even when faced with a petition that bears 25,000 signatures to look into Aiplex. This &quot;Nintendo&quot; situation is only a small piece of a larger puzzle. So many small channels are needlessly at stake."

They just want to be internet famous and/or have a popular channel.)<br><br>2. Their intention is to blackmail the targeted channel or other similar channels. (They could be trying to extort the copyright striked channel, saying; \u201cIf you pay us $_<i>___</i> money, we\u2019ll lift/remove the strikes\u201d.

They claim these videos are using footage from No Way Home but that is not the case. Original works, such a parody I wrote, filmed, and produced have been taken down for &quot;pirating&quot; footage from the newest film. Seems that has been the only reason they use to take down content, irregardless of what the video is. &quot;Bully Maguire&quot; meme channels have been a high target from these assholes lately, and their videos, or even channels in worst cases, are terminated for &quot;using NWH footage.&quot; These guys aren&#39;t even a legitimate company, and YouTube has refused to get involved. It&#39;s one thing to have this kind of content taken down by copyright owners (such as Sony, Disney, or Insomniac because even GAMEPLAY footage has been taken down), but Aiplex owns NOTHING. They aren&#39;t a real company with any real legal standing to do this to anyone. I made a video detailing the entire situation in-depth, which Aiplex even tried to take down, even though it&#39;s just me talking into a camera with no background music. We need bigger YouTubers to speak out about this. YouTube refuses to get involved, even when faced with a petition that bears 25,000 signatures to look into Aiplex. This &quot;Nintendo&quot; situation is only a small piece of a larger puzzle. So many small channels are needlessly at stake."

Someone can&#39;t just be the IMPosTer and pose as Nintendo to take down those videos is just a conspiracy theorist to me. Any idea of it could have easily exploited. Yet, we&#39;ve never heard of such a thing until some random Twitter user addressed it. Already existing evidence simply outweighs it, and I am still not convinced one bit."

If everyone thinks Nintendo&#39;s to blame, the gaming company themselves may have a chat with Youtube over their worsening rep, and a wealthy company like them may have more sway. If the plan&#39;s discovered, which it has been, word will get around that people can trick Youtube into taking down basically anything and if it becomes a trend, it could destroy the site, this FORCES Youtube to change the way their copyright rules work in order to save their platform."

Someone <b>else</b> striking or claiming them when they don&#39;t even work for Nintendo is even more ridiculous, not to mention claiming them is just outright theft if you don&#39;t have the rights to the content to begin with."

    "comment": "@abraham narvaez But this doesn&#39;t actually make logical sense. Many Nintendo music channels have been struck with similar strikes and some even taken down completely, take Brawl (forgot the rest of his username) for example, who got terminated. Gilva is only one among many of these Nintendo music Legacy channels, among others I can think of are Deoxy Prime and the one with the Link PFP (do not let my poor memory affect the context of the argument!) These channels rarely interact with each other as far as I know, and a rivalry makes little sense considering many of these channels cater to slightly different audiences, Gilva uploaded the raw music, many other channels upload extended versions.<br><br>The saddest thing is, Gilva probably had the LARGEST stockpile of Nintendo music on Youtube, it&#39;s a shame seeing the channel go, especially with the knowledge that some of the tracks may never be uploaded again for a very, very long time. I would believe a rivalry if music channels were competitive in even the slightest, but Gilva had a &quot;dead&quot; or better, a slightly inactive channel, rarely uploading for they had already uploaded the majority of content they wanted to or had. Gilva wasn&#39;t competition to begin with."
